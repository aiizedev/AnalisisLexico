# C-Like Language Calculator

This project implements a simple calculator for a C-like programming language. It includes a lexical analyzer (lexer) and a syntactic analyzer (parser) to perform lexical and syntactic analysis on input code.

## Project Structure

```
c_like_calc
├── src
│   ├── lexer.py       # Lexical analyzer that tokenizes the input code.
│   ├── parser.py      # Syntactic analyzer that processes tokens and constructs the AST.
│   └── main.py        # Entry point of the application.
├── tests
│   └── test_cases.txt  # Test cases for the lexer and parser.
└── README.md          # Documentation for the project.
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd c_like_calc
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the calculator, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```

You can input C-like code snippets, and the program will perform lexical and syntactic analysis, outputting the results.

## Lexer Overview

The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input code. It recognizes keywords, operators, and identifiers, converting them into a stream of tokens for the parser.

## Parser Overview

The parser processes the token stream generated by the lexer. It defines the grammar rules for the C-like language and constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens.

## Test Cases

The `tests/test_cases.txt` file contains various test cases to validate the functionality of the lexer and parser. It includes examples of both valid and invalid code snippets.
